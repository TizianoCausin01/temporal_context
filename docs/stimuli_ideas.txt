tenets:
- if possible, in their familiar enclosures
- if possible, people/monkeys they know already
- if possible, the "real"/most important object/information should appear in it's fullness (and in the center of the screen) only at the end of the video

Brainstorm:
turning face
face going to be occluded
occluded face going to be uncovered
face that moves towards the center
face that moves from center to outside
monkey locomotion/monkey climbing
well known affiliation/intimidatory expressions (like lip-smacking or yawning)
people giving them treatments
humans wearing known DPIs doing something they do every day in the cages and then in the end they take off the DPIs
